## Deck Photographer

This small script takes any decklist from an MTGO list and pulls all card images as jpg files into your directory.

## Usage

1. Download files included in the project. There should be two - the python runner file, and requirements.txt
1. Install the script's dependencies by opening a command line and running the following command:

    `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

1. Run the Runner.py script
1. When the file dialog appears, select the decklist you want to download pictures for

The jpg files should appear in your directory in a subdirectory called DeckPictures after a moment or two!

Enjoy!
