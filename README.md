## Deck Photographer

This small script takes any decklist from an MTGO list and pulls all card images as jpg files into your directory.

This work is free of course, but if you like mtg, gadgetry, and nerd stuff feel free to [follow me on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/izzitmichaela) for more projects!

## Usage

1. Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
1. Download the files included in this project. There should be two - the python runner file, and requirements.txt.
1. Install the script's dependencies by opening a command line and running the following command:

    `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

1. Run the Runner.py script
1. When the file dialog appears, select the decklist you want to download pictures for

The jpg files should appear in your directory in a subdirectory called DeckPictures after a moment or two!

Enjoy!
